#### Key Components
1. **Amazon Lex:** A fully managed AI service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text. It utilizes natural language understanding **(NLU)** and automatic speech recognition **(ASR)** to create dynamic and engaging chat experiences.
2. **Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock:** Enhances the chatbotâ€™s capabilities by integrating external knowledge sources. This enables retrieval-augmented generation **(RAG)**, allowing the bot to provide accurate and context-aware responses based on real-time data.

#### Workshop Objectives
1. Learn how to set up and configure **Amazon Lex** to design chatbot interactions.
2. Integrate **Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock** to improve response accuracy.
3. Implement retrieval-augmented generation **(RAG)** to pull real-time knowledge from documents, databases, or web sources.
